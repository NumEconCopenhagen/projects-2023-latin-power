    "The model presented by Yed Ben-Porath in 1967 (1) applies theory from capital investment models to study the decision to invest in education in the life-cycle (here two periods). This model treats education is an investment because the individuals need time/resources to invest in it, there are uncertain future returns, and there is depreciation from losing abilities or abilities that start to be obsolete.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model presents a representative individual whose chooses how much time to invest in education (form 0 to 1) in time t and time t+1, and how much invest in labor market, with the aim of maximizing his utility (life-time utility). Education increases human capital which increases the wages won at the labor market, and the individual is impatience ($\\rho$).\n",

    "Where $U_t$ and $U_{t+1}$ are the utility from study, which is equal to the benefits of studing, i.e. the wage received at labor market which is the return of human capital; this return depends on how much labor market values human capital ($\\beta_t$ and $\\beta_{t+1}$). Hence, $U_t = \\beta_t * H_t$ and $U_{t+1} = \\beta_{t+1} * H_{t+1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$C_t$ and $C_{t+1}$ are the cost of studying. These costs come from the direct cost of school such as fees ($\\gamma$), which is the same for all individuals, plus the opportunity cost of studying because of not working for a wage. Hence, $C_t= (\\gamma * S_t) + (S_t * \\beta_t * H_t)$, and $C_{t+1}= (\\gamma * S_{t+1}) + (S_{t+1} * \\beta_{t+1} * H_{t+1})$\n",

In addition, we have $A$ which is exogeneous initial level of ability, $E_t$ which is the level of government investment in education, $S_t$ is the level of education, and $H_t$ is the previous human capital level.\n",
